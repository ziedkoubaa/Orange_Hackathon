# AvaRich

## Inspiration  
In Tunisia, poverty and unemployment remain persistent challenges, affecting countless families and individuals. Witnessing these economic struggles firsthand, we felt a strong desire to create a solution that could empower people to manage their finances better and build a brighter future. The alarming statistics of poverty-related suicides and financial instability drove us to innovate and take action.
